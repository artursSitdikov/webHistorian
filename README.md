# webHistorian

Hello ppl!

I love history. I love to spectate how the object was changed from its beggining till current time. 
I also love exploring. Hope you would love to explore this repo to see how the Web was changed starting from 1991 when Tim Berners-Lee created the first web page till current time.

I must apologise for my English in advance, English is not my first language.
In this repo I will try to create identical web page for each for different year starting for 1991 till 2025.

Hope it will be interesting for you, as well as me to try some outdated techonlogy
