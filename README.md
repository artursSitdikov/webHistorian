Hello, everyone!

I love history and enjoy observing how objects evolve from their beginnings to the present day. I also love exploring. I hope you’ll enjoy exploring this repository to see how the Web has changed since 1991, when Tim Berners-Lee created the first web page, up to the present.

I must apologize in advance for my English—it's not my first language. In this repository, I will attempt to recreate an identical web page for each year from 1991 to 2025.

I hope you find it as interesting as I do to experiment with outdated technology!
